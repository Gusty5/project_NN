# project_NN

data is dowloaded from http://conradsanderson.id.au/lfwcrop/

extract the .zip into the data folder, it should look like:

data/
  faces/
    'image data in .ppm format'
  lists/
    'extra stuff inside the .zip (unimportant at the moment)'
  NON-SMILE_list.txt
  SMILE_list.txt

the .txt are the labels (kinda weird way to save them)

Currently, the notebooks part is the script to get the data so that it can be used, and the example of how to use the script.
